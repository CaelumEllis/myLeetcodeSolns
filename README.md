# myLeetcodeSolns
Just a collection of leetcode problems I have done, I do not know if I will go past 5 min problems as I think I am better spent practicing larger code problems in the form of projects.

NOTE:
This repo is beginning to hold more DSA uni content than leetCode, may clone out my uni projects to a dedicated repo.
